# a list of patients (a collection) doesn't have an "is-a" relationship with a single patient but rather has patients..
# Instead of inheriting from Patient, create a separate class to manage the collection of patients.
# This class will use composition by containing a list of Patient instances
# they now have individual responsibilitiesâ€”Patient for storing individual patient data
# List for managing the collection of patients.
